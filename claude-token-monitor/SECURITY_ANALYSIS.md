  - Directory traversal prevention (`../` and `..\\` blocked)
  - Path canonicalization to resolve symlinks
  - Boundary validation (paths restricted to safe directories)
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - Path traversal attacks prevented

#### 3. JSON Parsing Security Limits - RESOLVED
- **Location:** `src/services/file_monitor.rs:13-16, 264-287`

- **Sensitive Data Redacted:**
  - Session IDs → `[REDACTED]`
  - Message IDs → `[REDACTED]`
  - Request IDs → `[REDACTED]`
- **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - Information disclosure prevented

#### 6. Dependency Security Auditing - IMPLEMENTED
- **Location:** `.cargo/config.toml`, `scripts/security-audit.sh`
- **Implementation:** Automated security audit pipeline
- **Features:**
  - Cargo audit integration for vulnerability scanning

## Current Security Assessment

### Security Posture: EXCELLENT

#### Strengths
1. **Memory Safety:** Rust's ownership system + no unsafe code blocks + overflow checks
2. **Input Validation:** Comprehensive path validation with canonicalization
3. **Resource Protection:** JSON parsing limits prevent resource exhaustion
4. **Information Security:** Sensitive data redaction in debug output
5. **Build Security:** Hardened compilation flags and security features
6. **Continuous Monitoring:** Automated security audit pipeline
7. **Attack Surface Minimization:** No network communication, file-based only

#### Security Controls Implemented

- Proper lifetime management for all resources
- Overflow checks enabled in build configuration
- Frame pointers enabled for better security debugging

##### Information Security
- Sensitive data redaction in all debug output
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Minimal logging of potentially sensitive information
- User control over all data paths and access

##### Build Security
